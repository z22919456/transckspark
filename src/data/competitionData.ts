  theme: 'Conceptual Design Competition for Heart of the Capital: A Vision for Transforming Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Park',
  statements: [
    "Chiang Kai-Shek Memorial Park (CKS Memorial Park), located in the middle of Taipei City, is an important public space in Taiwan's present-day capital. It is also a site that draws the hearts of the people together, and where their hopes and dreams manifest. The sights and sites of CKS Memorial Park and its surroundings have become palimpsests of history that tell complex and diverse narratives. The CKS Memorial Park, which has become an integral part of the life of each historical subject that crosses its path, is a focal point of myriad urban lifestyles and signification, simultaneously being a symbol of authoritarianism, internal strife, day-to-day life, civil society, political and social movements, as well as art, culture, and leisure.",
    'In recent years, the Taiwanese society has been actively engaged in conversations on issues such as transitional justice, the future of the ordinary citizen, and the projected image of the capital city. The vibrancy of the exchanges does not merely reflect the capacity of the Taiwanese society to hold diverse dialectics but also presents challenges to professionals working with urban public spaces. These professionals are now tasked to reexamine the sites that were created during the authoritarian rule of the 19th and 20th centuries, as they consider how to create visions of contemporary life and a city of the future. In addition, they also have to find a way to allow the heart of the capital city to move away from being a physical embodiment of authoritarian rule and regime. Only after the transformation of the site can the above visions of the public domain be realized.',
    "As a result, this competition invites artists to imagine a future space that allows the hearts of citizens to join as one. This way, the new vision of CKS Memorial Park would become part of an open dialogue and the visual experience brought on by the competition would in turn facilitate more discussions and provide more stimuli pertaining to the issue of urban transformation. This process of reflection will hence engender yet another round of social conversation. The competition aims to attract diverse proposals that suggest a multitude of ways to transform this public space while taking into account the complex social context of Taiwan, in order that even more perspectives for debate can emerge. At the end of the day, we hope that such a process would shape an image of Taiwan's capital city that represents the hope of the people today, allows societal values to progress, and realizes this generation's imagining of the future.",

  topics: {
    content: "This call for entries attaches great importance to the designer's reflections on history and culture, the creativity of their spatial design, and the feasibility of long-term applicability of their conceptual design. Participating individuals and teams are also encouraged to be part of various Public Participation activities organized by the event committee. Since the CKS Memorial Park is a major landmark in the heart of Taiwan's capital, the design proposal must be viable for a diverse range of day-to-day functions, incorporating responses to social relations, interpretations of history, cultural symbols, and contemporary issues. The architectural space can then be a force that shapes contemporary urban life and at the same time creates new value for society. Therefore, designs entered into the competition should cover the following aspects: Fresh Interpretations, Spatial Transformation, and New Usage. ",
    freshInterpretations: 'Fresh interpretations of the CKS Memorial Park must be rooted in the historical context of the site. Changes proposed are to be substantive and seek to remove signs of authoritarianism, engage in dialogue with history, observe the values of democracy and freedom in contemporary society, meet the diverse and varied lifestyle needs of citizens, and respond to major social issues. Such an approach would enable the idea of transformation to gain a foothold in present-day society and, subsequently, empower the society to stride confidently into the future. ',
    spatialTransformation: 'In view of the geographical particularity of the locale and the forward-looking nature of Taipei City’s cultural strategies, the proposal should contain specific suggestions on both the functions of and meaning behind the revamped CKS Memorial Park, and all proposed changes should be made with a thorough consideration of the spatial characteristics and character of the architecture. When exploring the relationship between specific architectural elements and space, designers ought to and ecology.',
    newsUsage: 'The proposal should introduce novel ideas for the CKS Memorial Park and its surrounding site by proposing new uses of the space. The ideas, which shall anticipate the needs of the future urban dwellers, mediate between the various interactions in the public space, and suggest a mechanism for sustainable operation of the site, could create new possibilities in terms of the services rendered by and functions of the CKS Memorial Park. ',
    note: 'Note: In order to allow more creative ideas to be brought into play and more voices to be heard in this social dialogue, entries submitted do not need to take regulations into consideration governing the management of public spaces, such as cultural assets, urban planning, and urban design.',

  statements: [ // 活動宣言
    '位處台北城中的中正紀念堂園區，是當代首都城市重要的公共空間，也是市民之心凝結與再現之處。此區及週邊的地景在歷史長河中累疊成複雜且意義多元的歷史畫布，深刻的鑲嵌在每位歷史主體的生命經驗中，而威權統治象徵、府院機構、尋常生活、市民社會與政治社會動員、藝術文化休閒等不同城市生活樣態與意義交會則躍然其上。',
    '有鑒近年不斷生發的轉型正義、常民生活的明日願景、首都意象等思辨，不僅反應了台灣市民社會多元辯證的活力，也挑戰了空間專業者如何在創造當代生活與未來都市願景時，重思生發於十九、二十世紀的威權政治場域空間原型，甚而找出首都核心區如何走出既有威權象徵與統理思維結構的空間再現形式，藉以創造市民公共生活場域樣態的可能性。',
    '因此，此次競圖基於鼓勵參與者提出深具市民之心凝聚力的未來空間想像之前提，將中正紀念堂園區的新願景視為開放性思辨的一環，配合競圖引動的視覺體驗，會有更多回合轉型反省相關的討論和參照，形成再一波社會的互動溝通。期待透過競圖激盪出可回應台灣複雜社會脈絡的公共空間多元轉型提案，使得更多的討論視角浮現，進而找出鏈結當代期望、進步社會價值與未來想像的首都形貌。',
